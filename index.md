# Who I am

Iâ€™m an automation engineer, eager to improve my knowledge in humanoid robotics and to give a personal
contribution to the research. My work and my studies are motivated by personal achievements as well as
my passion on robotics. During my study and my research experience, I showed an excellent capability
of reaching goals by working on individual basis and teaming up with my collegues. I feel dealing with
challenging problems very exciting and thus I am very prone to work hard and find suitable solutions.

# 6 facts about me
