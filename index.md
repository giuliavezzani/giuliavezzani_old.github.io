# Who I am

I’m an automation engineer, eager to improve my knowledge in humanoid robotics and to give a personal
contribution to the research. My work and my studies are motivated by personal achievements as well as
my passion on robotics. During my study and my research experience, I showed an excellent capability
of reaching goals by working on individual basis and teaming up with my collegues. I feel dealing with
challenging problems very exciting and thus I am very prone to work hard and find suitable solutions.

# 6 facts about me
- _Automation engineer_, with one year experience on the humanoid robot _iCub_.
- Considerable theoretical background in automation and _Bayesian filtering_.
- Proven _C++ skills_, with a good knowledge of YARP and iCub libraries.
- 3 years experience on _Linux_-based systems.
- _Hardware experience_ with the humanoid robotic platform iCub.
- Main interests in _humanoid robotics_: grasping, localization, manupilation, perception, vision
  and 3D object modeling.
  
  
# Short bio

I was born in Florence in 1991. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Electronic and Telecommunications
Engineering (cum laude) in July 2013 at the Universita‘ degli Studi di Firenze. In the same university, in
October 2015, I held my Master’s degree (cum laude) in Electrical and Automation Engineering, with the
dissertation of the thesis "3D object tactile localization for the humanoid robot iCub." Currently, I am a
PhD fellow in Bioengineering and Advanced Robotics - curriculum Advanced and Humanoid Robotics - at
the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genova, iCub Facility, in collaboration with the Universita‘ di Genova.
The goal of my PhD program is to improve object localization and manipulation for humanoid robots, by
exploiting both visual and tactile information and to implement and test the developed techniques on the
humanoid robot iCub.

# Current position

I am a **Phd Fellow** @ iCub Facility (Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia), Bioengineering and Advanced
 Robotics, curriculum Humanoid and Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia &
currently Universita‘ di Genova, Genova, Italy.
My research project consists of improving 3D object modeling, localization, grasping and manipulation,
by merging vision and tactile information for the humanoid robot iCub.
