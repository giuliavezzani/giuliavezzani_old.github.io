# Who I am
I am a **PhD candidate and research fellow** in humanoid robotics, with **automation engineering** background and four year
**research experience**.

My current position and my past studies have taught me how to _solve challenging problems_, quickly
_develop new skills_, _team up_ with people with different backgrounds and _supervise and manage_ research
activity of other students.

In my future employments, I am eager to keep giving my personal contribution to research in humanoid
robotics and AI. I feel dealing with challenging problems very exciting and thus I am very prone to work
hard and find suitable solutions.

# 6 facts about me
- _**Researcher in robotics**_ and AI with four year experience.
- Proven _**C++** skills_, with a good knowledge of YARP and iCub libraries.
- _Tensorflow_ and _Python_ knowledge for Deep Reinforcement Learning.
- Background: _Robotics_, _Bayesian filtering_, _Optimization_ and _**Deep Reinforcement Learning**_.
- Daily research and work activities on Unix-based systems.
- _Hardware experience_ with the humanoid robotic platform **iCub**.
- Main interests: **Grasping**, Localization,  **Perception**,  3D
object modeling and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.
  
  

# Current position

I am a **Phd candidate and research fellow** @ iCub Facility (Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia)

The goal of my research is to improve _perception_ and _manipulation skills_ for humanoid robots, by
exploiting both _visual_ and _tactile information_. All my new ideas have been implemented in C++ and
tested on the humanoid robot iCub.

Recently, I got interested in _Artificial Intelligence_ and, in particular, _Deep Reinforcement Learning_ for
robotics. I strongly believe that robots autonomous skills can be improved by combining model-based
and learning techniques.

# Achievements
- **Modeling and Grasping Pipeline for the Humanoid Robot iCub**. I developed a new modeling and grasping method based on superquadric functions. The C++
  implementation is available for the iCub humanoid robot. More information are available 
  [here](https://github.com/robotology/superquadric-grasp-demo).
- **Handover Pipeline for the Humanoid Robot iCub**.  I designed an autonomous pipeline for executing the handover task with the humanoid robot iCub. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be27-FGU-Sk)
  is a video of the pipeline execution.
- **6-DOF Tactile Localization Algorithm**.  During my master thesis, I designed a novel localization algorithm, able to localize known objects by
  using only 3D points belonging to the object surface. This algorithm has been used also for object
  recognition and visual localization.

<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
 <summary>  <b>Visiting Scholar @ BAIR, UC Berkeley (January - July 2018)</b> </summary>
       <p style="margin-left: 25px;">     
       My research activity at Bair focuses on the design of new deep reinforcement learning techniques
        aimed at improving robot manipulation and grasping capabilities.

 <summary>  <b>Easy Peasy Robotics Mentor @ Campus Party Italia (2017)</b>  </summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">I was one of the mentors and organizers of Easy Peasy Robotics, a 2-days crash course whose aim
was to provide participants with a brief overview of the research problems and applications related to
humanoid robot programming, from perception to control. An  <b>interview</b> (in Italian)  about Campus Party experience is available <a  href="http://bancadati.datavideo.it/PortaleDV/media/20170722/20170722-rai_news_24-rai_news_24_1311-154526847m.mp4">here.</a></p></details>
<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
 <summary>  <b>Europen Project TacMan: Tactile Manipulation (2017)</b>  </summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">TacMan is a project founded by the European Union, FP7 ICT Cognitive System and Robotics, no. 610967.
        My work for the TacMan project contributed to improving <b>recognition and manipulation skills</b> for the
humanoid robot iCub. I developed a model-based tactile object localization and recognition algorithm
and a novel pipeline in order to make the iCub robot perform the <b>handover task</b>, i.e. transfer an
object from one hand to the other. A  <b>video</b> of successful handovers is available  <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be27-FGU-Sk&feature=youtu.be">here.</a></p></details>
 <details style="margin-left: 20px;">
   <summary> <b>Brains, Minds and Machines Summer School (BMM 2016)</b>  </summary>
   <p style="margin-left: 25px;"> BMM summer school is organized by Harvard Medical School
September, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, US. An intensive three-week course gives advanced students a “deep end” introduction to the problem
of intelligence – how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate
intelligence in machines. The summer school selection process is very competitive due to the increasing number of applications and the small number of available positions. In  2016,  30 students have been selected among 300 nearly. The school requires the accomplishment of a 3 week project, for which I implemented an algorithm, capable of <b>detecting and recognize activities in real videos</b>. I achieved my goal by modeling the problem through <b>Hidden Markov Models</b> and by using <b>Bayesian Regression</b> as main approach.</p>

   <summary>  <b>International Computer Vision Summer School (ICVSS 2016)</b>  </summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">The International Computer Vision Summer School is organized by University
of Cambridge and University of Catania,  Italy.
The tenth edition of ICVSS  provided both an
objective and clear overview and an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art research in Computer
Vision. The courses were delivered by world renowned experts in the field, from both academia and
industry, and covered both theoretical and practical aspects of real Computer Vision problems as
well as examples of their successful commercialisation. (Selected students: 150/396.)</p>
