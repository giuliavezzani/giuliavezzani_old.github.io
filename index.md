# Who I am

I’m an **automation engineer**, eager to improve my knowledge in **humanoid robotics** and to give a personal
contribution to the research. My work and my studies are motivated by personal achievements as well as
my passion on robotics. During my study and my research experience, I showed an excellent capability
of reaching goals by working on individual basis and teaming up with my collegues. I feel dealing with
challenging problems very exciting and thus I am very prone to work hard and find suitable solutions.

# 6 facts about me

- Considerable theoretical background in automation and _Bayesian filtering_.
- Proven _**C++** skills_, with a good knowledge of YARP and iCub libraries.
- 3 years experience on _**Linux**_-based systems.
- _Hardware experience_ with the humanoid robotic platform **iCub**.
- Main interests in _humanoid robotics_: **grasping**, **localization**, **manupilation**, perception, vision
  and 3D object modeling.
  
  
# Short bio

I was born in Florence in 1991. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Electronic and Telecommunications
Engineering (cum laude) in July 2013 at the Universita‘ degli Studi di Firenze. In the same university, in
October 2015, I held my Master’s degree (cum laude) in Electrical and Automation Engineering, with the
dissertation of the thesis "3D object tactile localization for the humanoid robot iCub." Currently, I am a
PhD fellow in Bioengineering and Advanced Robotics - curriculum Advanced and Humanoid Robotics - at
the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genova, iCub Facility, in collaboration with the Universita‘ di Genova.
The goal of my PhD program is to improve object localization and manipulation for humanoid robots, by
exploiting both visual and tactile information and to implement and test the developed techniques on the
humanoid robot iCub.

# Current position

I am a **Phd Fellow** @ iCub Facility (Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia), Bioengineering and Advanced
 Robotics, curriculum Humanoid and Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia &
currently Universita‘ di Genova, Genova, Italy.
My research project consists of improving 3D object modeling, localization, grasping and manipulation,
by merging **vision and tactile information** for the humanoid robot iCub.

   <summary> <li style="margin-left: 50px;"> <b>Europen Project TacMan: Tactile Manipulation (2017)</b> </li> </summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">TacMan is a project founded by the European Union, FP7 ICT Cognitive System and Robotics, no. 610967.
        My work for the TacMan project contributed to improving <b>recognition and manipulation skills</b> for the
humanoid robot iCub. I developed a model-based tactile object localization and recognition algorithm
and a novel pipeline in order to make the iCub robot perform the <b>handover task</b>, i.e. transfer an
object from one hand to the other.</p>

   <p style="margin-left: 50px;"> BMM summer school is organized by Harvard Medical School
September, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, US. An intensive three-week course will give advanced students a “deep end” introduction to the problem
of intelligence – how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate
intelligence in machines. (Selected students: 30/300 nearly.) The school required the accomplishment of a 3 week project, for which I implemented an algorithm, capable of <b>detecting and recognize activities in real videos</b>. We achieved our goal by modeling the problem through <b>Hidden Markov Models</b> and by using </b>Bayesian Regression</b> as main approach.</p>

The tenth edition of the International Computer Vision Summer School aims to provide both an
objective and clear overview and an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art research in Computer
Vision. The courses will be delivered by world renowned experts in the field, from both academia and
industry, and will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of real Computer Vision problems as
well as examples of their successful commercialisation. (Selected students: 150/396.)</p>
